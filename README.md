# Real-Time Quiz Application
## Introduction
This project is a real-time quiz application built using PHP with Workerman for handling WebSocket connections, along with a simple HTML/JavaScript frontend. The quiz allows users to join a quiz session using a unique Quiz ID and User ID, answer questions, and see their scores update in real-time on a leaderboard.

### Key Features:
- Real-time Question Display: Users are shown the same questions at the same time and can submit their answers.
- Real-time Leaderboard: Scores are updated live and a leaderboard is displayed as users answer questions.
- Quiz Flow: All users answer a question before moving to the next, and the quiz is only marked complete when all users have finished.
## How to Set Up?
Follow these steps to set up and run the Real-Time Quiz Application locally.

### Prerequisites
Before setting up, ensure you have the following installed:

```markdown
PHP (>= 7.4)
Composer (for managing PHP dependencies)
Node.js (for building the frontend if needed)
```

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```markdown
bash
git clone https://github.com/hoangphammr/quiz-challenge.git
cd quiz-challenge
```

2. Install Dependencies
Use Composer to install PHP dependencies (including Workerman, which is used to handle WebSocket connections):

```markdown
bash
composer install
```

This will install all necessary packages defined in composer.json.

3. Start the WebSocket Server
Navigate to the project root and run the WebSocket server using Workerman:

```markdown
bash
php server.php
```

By default, the WebSocket server will run on port 9502. You can adjust the port in the server.php file if needed.

You should see output similar to:

```markdown
bash
Workerman started at http://0.0.0.0:9502
The server will now be ready to handle WebSocket connections.
```

4. Start the Web Server (Optional)
If you need a local server to serve the frontend HTML, you can use PHPâ€™s built-in web server:

```markdown
bash
php -S localhost:8000
This will start a local server at http://localhost:8000, where the frontend can be accessed.
```

5. Open the Frontend
In your browser, navigate to the URL where your frontend is served (http://localhost:8000 by default). The frontend will allow you to enter your User ID and Quiz ID to join a quiz session.

6. Play the Quiz
Enter a User ID and a Quiz ID to join a quiz.
The first question will appear once you join, and you can select an answer.
After all users have answered a question, the next question will be displayed.
The leaderboard will update in real-time as users answer questions.

## Troubleshooting
Error: WebSocket connection failed

Make sure your WebSocket server (php server.php) is running.
Ensure no other services are using port 8080 (or whatever port you have set).
Error: Leaderboard not updating

Ensure that the WebSocket connection is working and that the backend is sending updates properly.
Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors.

## Conclusion
This project is a simple implementation of a real-time quiz application using WebSockets. It demonstrates how you can create interactive real-time applications with PHP and JavaScript. You can extend it further by adding more features like user authentication, multiple quizzes, and even adding different types of questions.
